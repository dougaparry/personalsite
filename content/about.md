I am an early career researcher in Socio Informatics with interests in *Computational Social Science, Human-Computer Interaction*, and *Cyberpsychology*. My research concerns the interplay between digital technologies, human cognition, behaviour, performance, and affective well-being across a variety of life-situations.

 I hold a faculty position teaching and supervising within the undergraduate and postgraduate Socio Informatics programs as part of the [Department of Information Science](http://suinformatics.com) at Stellenbosch University. As a member of the [Cognition and Technology Research Group (CTRG)](http://suinformatics.com/ctrg/), I am involved in a number of research projects concerning the interplay between digital technologies, human cognition and affective wellbeing. My research interests include: media effects, human computer interaction, and cyberpsychology. I hold a bachelors degree majoring in *Socio-Informatics* and *Economics*, Honours and Masters degrees in *Socio-Informatics* and am currently working towards a doctoral degree (PhD in Socio Informatics) specifically focusing on media multitasking and cognitive control.
